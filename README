Tip Tracing
===========

This code, and the libraries it generates are intended for tip tracing in sheets
of cardiac tissue.  Both a standalone executable and a library are generated by
the Makefile.

For an explanation of the algorithm used, please see the comments included in
tip_trace.h.  At present the binary will read binary float or double sheets and
output a tip trace to file

usage
-----

To use the program is very simple:

  $ make

Makes both the binaries and the library.  For a usage summary of the binary

  ./core_trace -h
